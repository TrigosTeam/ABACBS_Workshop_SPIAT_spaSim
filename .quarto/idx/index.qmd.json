{"title":"Overview of the workshop","markdown":{"yaml":{"title":"Overview of the workshop"},"headingText":"Welcome","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n\n\nIn this workshop we will introduce two R packages we developed for the analysis and simulation of spatial proteomics data (multiplex immunohistochemistry, CODEX, MIBI, IMC, etc) published this year in Nature Communications (Feng et al. 2023). SPIAT (SPatial Image Analysis of Tissues) is a spatial-platform agnostic toolkit with a suite of spatial analysis algorithms, and spaSim (spatial Simulator) is a novel simulator of tissue spatial patterns.\n\nThe workshop is designed for those who would like to get started with or improve their capacity to perform spatial data analyses. We will cover how to handle spatial proteomics data, from reading, formatting, and extensive spatial analysis through SPIAT's six analysis modules. These range from quality control and visualisation to more advanced topics such as cell colocalisation, spatial heterogeneity, tumour structure characterisation, and neighbourhood identification.\n\nDuring the workshop, you will get an overview of the analysis workflow and understand the rationale behind specific functions. You will get your hands dirty by designing an analysis workflow using a real example dataset, so you'll learn by doing.\n\n## Time and Location\n\n-   Friday 8 December 2023 09:00-12:30 AEST\n-   [Room 371, Andrew N.

The workshop will provide both a standardised way and a workflow to approach the analysis of a spatial dataset, as well as empower users who would like to incorporate SPIAT and spaSim into their spatial analyses.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n-   Basic programming skills in R (Familiarity with using R functions and installing R packages)\n-   Background knowledge in spatial proteomics\n\n## Set up requirements\n\nPlease complete the [Setup Instructions](docs/Setup.qmd) before the course. If you have any trouble, please get in contact with us ASAP (yuzhou.feng\\@petermac.org).\n\n## Learning objectives\n\nBy the end of this workshop, you will master the SPIAT functions and design workflows for spatial proteomics data analysis and gain some insights into the ways of handling spatial proteomics data.\n\n## Workshop organisers\n\n-   Yuzhou Feng\n\nLaboratory Research | Trigos Lab | Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre \n\nYuzhou Feng is a Research Assistant in the Trigos Lab at Peter Mac.

    "text": "In this workshop we will introduce two R packages we developed for the analysis and simulation of spatial proteomics data (multiplex immunohistochemistry, CODEX, MIBI, IMC, etc) published this year in Nature Communications (Feng et al. 2023). SPIAT (SPatial Image Analysis of Tissues) is a spatial-platform agnostic toolkit with a suite of spatial analysis algorithms, and spaSim (spatial Simulator) is a novel simulator of tissue spatial patterns.\nThe workshop is designed for those who would like to get started with or improve their capacity to perform spatial data analyses. We will cover how to handle spatial proteomics data, from reading, formatting, and extensive spatial analysis through SPIAT’s six analysis modules. These range from quality control and visualisation to more advanced topics such as cell colocalisation, spatial heterogeneity, tumour structure characterisation, and neighbourhood identification.\nDuring the workshop, you will get an overview of the analysis workflow and understand the rationale behind specific functions. You will get your hands dirty by designing an analysis workflow using a real example dataset, so you’ll learn by doing."
